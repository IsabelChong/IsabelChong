### Hi there 👋 I'm Isabel!
<p> Fun fact: I was previously majoring in Biomedical Engineering, but chose to jump ship to take up programming instead as it's so fun! </p>
<p> Do stay 🤲🏻, follow 💞, and look 🫣 at what I can create throughout my journey 🕹 🖥.</p>
<p> <i>psst</i> I'm currently learning how to build web applications and learning HTML.</p>
